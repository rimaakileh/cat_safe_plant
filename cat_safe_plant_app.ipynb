Since the model was previously saved in cell `a042f75d`, I will assume the save was successful and the issue is the file path. I need to make sure the model file is accessible. I will regenerate the code block to include loading the model and integrating the prediction logic, ensuring the file path is correct if it's in a different location than the current directory. Since I don't have information about the current directory or the exact location of the saved model, I will proceed with the assumption that the file should be in the current directory and regenerate the code.
