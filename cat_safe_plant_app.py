## Welcome to the No Poisioned Cat Project

Requirement Statement: We aim to protect cats from toxic plants.

Problem Facing: House plants can be toxic to cats. Ingesting toxic plant might not kill a cat, but they are still harmful to cats and cat owners can incur high vet bills.
"""



"""# Task
Write Python code for a cat-safe plant identification app. The app should allow users to upload an image of a plant and determine if it is toxic or safe for cats. Include comments explaining the code, placeholders for importing Kaggle datasets ("toxic_plants.csv", "safe_plants.csv"), and a basic structure for image processing, model loading, and prediction.

## Data acquisition

Download relevant datasets from Kaggle containing images of plants labeled as toxic or safe for cats.

Add comments as placeholders for downloading the datasets from Kaggle.

**Reasoning**:

"""

# Summary of Accomplishments So Far:

# 1. Data Acquisition and Loading (Cell OZolKM9nbfob):
#    - Placeholder comments were added for downloading toxic and safe plant datasets from Kaggle.
#    - Code was written to load images from specified toxic and safe plant dataset paths using OpenCV (`cv2`).
#    - Images are resized to a target size (128x128 pixels) and stored in a list.
#    - Labels (1 for toxic, 0 for safe) are assigned to the corresponding images and stored in a list.
#    - The image and label lists are converted to NumPy arrays.
#    - A warning was printed indicating that one of the specified safe plant folders was not found.
#    - The total number of loaded images and labels is printed.

# 2. Data Preprocessing (Cells 62346c49 and 67a79b1c):
#    - Images are explicitly resized again to the target size of 128x128 pixels, confirming the size used for processing.
#    - The pixel values of the processed images are normalized to the range [0, 1] by converting the data type to float32 and dividing by 255.0.

# 3. Data Augmentation (Cell d6e75c30):
#    - An `ImageDataGenerator` object from Keras is set up with various augmentation techniques (rotation, shifting, shearing, zooming, horizontal flipping).
#    - This generator is intended to be used during model training to increase the dataset size and improve generalization, although it is not actively used in the subsequent training step in this notebook.

# 4. Model Definition (Cell 1731a266):
#    - A deep learning model is defined using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model (without the top classification layer) as the base.
#    - A Global Average Pooling layer and a Dense layer with a sigmoid activation are added on top of the base model for binary classification.
#    - The layers of the pre-trained MobileNetV2 base model are frozen to prevent their weights from being updated during training.
#    - The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, binary crossentropy loss, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
#    - A summary of the model architecture is printed.

# 5. Model Training (Cell b616df65):
#    - The compiled model is trained using the loaded and processed image data and labels.
#    - The training is performed for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32.
#    - The training history is stored in the `history` variable.
#    - A message indicating the completion of model training is printed.

# 6. Model Saving (Cell a042f75d):
#    - The trained model is saved to a file named 'cat_safe_plant_model.h5'.
#    - A confirmation message is printed after saving the model.

# 7. Prediction Function (Cell 1af2eb01):
#    - A function `preprocess_image_for_prediction` is defined to load, resize, normalize, and add a batch dimension to a single image for prediction.
#    - A function `predict_plant_toxicity` is defined to take an image path, the trained model, target size, and a toxicity threshold as input.
#    - This function preprocesses the image using the defined function, gets a prediction from the model, and returns "Toxic" or "Safe" based on whether the prediction probability exceeds the threshold.
#    - An example usage of the `predict_plant_toxicity` function is provided as a comment.

# Current State:
# - Data loading and preprocessing are complete for the available data (with a warning about a missing folder).
# - A deep learning model based on MobileNetV2 has been defined and trained.
# - The trained model has been saved.
# - Functions for preprocessing a single image and making a toxicity prediction have been created.
# - The core logic for the plant toxicity prediction is in place, but a user interface for image upload and displaying predictions is still needed.

"""## Choose a ui framework

### Subtask:
Select a suitable Python framework for building the web application (e.g., Streamlit, Flask, or Django).

**Reasoning**:
Choose a suitable framework for building the web application based on the ease of use and suitability for simple applications with image upload and prediction display, and then state the chosen framework with reasoning. Streamlit is a good choice because it allows for rapid development of simple web applications with minimal code, which is ideal for this project's requirements of image upload and prediction display.
"""

# Framework Selection

# Considering the requirements for a simple user interface to upload an image
# and display a prediction, and prioritizing ease of use and rapid development,
# the following frameworks were evaluated:
# - Streamlit: Known for its simplicity and speed in creating interactive web apps
#   with Python scripts, suitable for data science and machine learning projects.
#   Handles image uploads and displaying results straightforwardly.
# - Flask: A lightweight micro web framework. More flexible than Streamlit but
#   requires more coding for building the user interface components.
# - Django: A high-level web framework, more suitable for complex applications
#   with databases and extensive features. Overkill for this project's needs.

# Based on the evaluation, Streamlit is the most suitable framework for this project
# due to its ease of use, quick development time, and direct integration with Python
# code for handling image uploads and displaying the prediction result from the
# existing model.

I will regenerate the code block to include loading the model and integrating the prediction logic, ensuring the file path is correct if it's in a different location than the current directory. Since I don't have information about the current directory or the exact location of the saved model, I will proceed with the assumption that the file should be in the current directory and regenerate the code. If it still fails, further investigation into the file location will be needed.

"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The project successfully loaded and preprocessed image data for toxic and safe plants, although a warning about a missing safe plant folder was noted.
*   A deep learning model based on a pre-trained MobileNetV2 was defined, trained for 10 epochs, and saved for future use.
*   Functions for preprocessing a single image and predicting plant toxicity were created.
*   Streamlit was selected as the framework for building the web user interface due to its simplicity and suitability for rapid development and image handling.
*   The Streamlit UI was designed and implemented, including a title, description, instructions, file uploader, image display, prediction result placeholder, and error handling.
*   Error handling was added to manage issues during model loading, image upload, and image processing, providing user feedback via Streamlit's error and warning messages.
*   The model loading process was enhanced using `st.cache_resource` to improve efficiency by loading the model only once.
*   The display of prediction results was refined using Streamlit's success and error alert types for "Safe" and "Toxic" predictions, respectively.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   Address the warning about the missing safe plant folder during data loading to ensure the model is trained on the complete dataset.
*   Consider adding a feature to display the prediction probability alongside the "Toxic" or "Safe" classification to provide users with more confidence in the prediction.
